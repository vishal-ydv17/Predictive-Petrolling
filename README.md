# Crime Prediction Pattern Classifier

This project uses the Boston Crime Dataset to build a crime prediction model that identifies the type and location of crimes. The goal is to assist city police in identifying high-risk areas for more effective patrolling. The model visualizes areas prone to specific crimes using colored clusters on a map.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download the Project

1. Download the entire project as a ZIP file from GitHub.

### Step 2: Data Setup

- The dataset is already included in the project folder, so there's no need to download an additional dataset.
- If you want to use an updated dataset, you can download the latest US Boston Crime datasets from 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023.

### Step 3: Open the Project

- Open the `predictive_patrolling.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

### Step 4: Set the Dataset Paths

- Provide the correct paths to the datasets in the code as needed.

### Step 5: Run the Code

- Execute each cell in the notebook to run the model and view the output.
